# hexcolor-game
A guessing game with colors and their hex values.

Instructions:
Click the button to start the game. A group of six colors will be given at random along with a hexcode. Any possible color has the chance to appear. Guess which color matches the hex value given by clicking on it. If your guess was incorrect you will be notified and will be able to see the hexvalue of the color you guessed. The incorrect color you guessed will then be removed from the pool of possible selections. If you are correct the game will stop and you will be congratulated. Press the start game button again to start a new game.

Challenges:
In this project one of my biggest challenges was finding a way to create multiple colors completely at random. I wanted the possibility of any color imaginable to have the chance of appearing in this game, and to do so without hard-coding it seemed impossible when I first started the project. Hard-coding them all would also have been a huge undertaking, hence the wish to completely automate that process. I was very proud when I made a function that could perform the task needed to create any color possible.
